* **NO `border-t` + `border-b` on every row of a long list / spec table.** Pick one (bottom-border between rows OR top-border above the group) and use it sparsely. A 10-row spec table with hairlines under each row is the laziest layout - see Section 4.9 for alternative UI components.
* **NO scoring/progress bars with filled background tracks** as comparison visuals. If you need to show "X out of Y" comparisons, prefer a number + small icon, or a tiny inline bar WITHOUT a background track. Big filled `bg-zinc-200` tracks with a partial fill on top are dashboard-UI clutter on a landing page.

**Locale, time, scroll cues**
* **Locale / city-name / time / weather strips are banned for 99% of briefs.** "Lisbon, working with founders" in the hero, "1200-690 Lisbon, Portugal" in the footer, "Lisbon 14:23 · 18°C" in the nav. These are agency-portfolio decoration tells. Allowed ONLY when: the brief explicitly describes a globally-distributed studio with timezone-relevant work, OR a travel-focused brand, OR a real-world physical venue. A single contact-address mention in the footer is fine; an atmospheric locale strip is not.
* **Scroll cues are banned.** `Scroll`, `↓ scroll`, `Scroll to explore`, `Scroll to walk through it`, animated mouse-wheel icons. If the user has not scrolled yet, they are looking at the hero. They know what scroll is. The bottom of the viewport does not need a label.
* **ZERO decorative status dots by default.** A coloured dot before nav items, before list rows, before badges, before status labels is a Tell. Only acceptable when conveying real semantic state (a live indicator on actual server status, a live availability flag) and limited to one per page section.

### 9.G EM-DASH BAN (the single most-violated Tell)

**Em-dash (`—`) is COMPLETELY banned.** It is the LLM's signature stylistic crutch and it is the #1 visual Tell in production tests. There is no "limited use" allowance, no "natural language frequency" allowance, no "in body copy is fine" allowance. None.

* **Banned in headlines.** Use a period or a comma.
* **Banned in eyebrows / labels / pills / button text / image captions / nav items.** Replace with line breaks, columns, or hairlines.
* **Banned in body copy.** Restructure the sentence: two sentences with a period, OR a comma, OR parentheses, OR a colon.
* **Banned in quote attribution.** Use a normal hyphen with spaces (` - `) or a line break + smaller-weight name.
* **Banned in en-dash form too (`–`) when used as a separator.** Date ranges (`2018-2026`) use a hyphen. Number ranges (`€40-80k`) use a hyphen.

The ONLY permitted dash characters on the page are:
* Regular hyphen `-` (for compound words, ranges, line dividers in markup)
* Minus sign in math (`-5°C`)

If your output contains a single `—` or `–` anywhere visible to the user, the output fails the Pre-Flight Check and must be rewritten.

This rule is non-negotiable. The agent has historically ignored em-dash limits when phrased as "use sparingly." The phrasing here is binary: zero em-dashes.

## 10. REFERENCE VOCABULARY (Pattern Names the Agent Should Know)

This is a vocabulary, not a library. The agent should KNOW these pattern names to communicate about them, design with them in mind, and reach for them when the design read calls for them. **Implementations and code sketches live in the Block Library (Section 12), which is populated iteratively.**
